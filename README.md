#  FloatChat : AI-Powered Conversational Interface for Argo Ocean Data

---

## Overview

**FloatChat** is an AI-driven conversational platform designed to make global **Argo float ocean data** accessible to everyone, from scientists and policymakers to students and enthusiasts.  

The project bridges the gap between **complex NetCDF datasets** and **intuitive natural language queries**, combining the power of **AI, structured databases, and interactive visualizations** into a single user-friendly interface.

---

##  Our Focus

- **Democratize access to ocean data**  
  Transform technical, domain-heavy datasets into insights that anyone can explore using natural language.

- **Leverage AI for discovery**  
  Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret user questions and translate them into actionable queries.

- **Integrate structured + unstructured data**  
  Blend relational databases (for float metadata and profiles) with vector databases (for semantic search and summaries).

- **Enable powerful visualizations**  
  Deliver interactive maps, float trajectories, profile plots, and timeâ€“depth visualizations through a clean dashboard.

- **Focus on usability & trust**  
  Provide explanations, show provenance (where the data came from), and maintain transparency in answers.

## What FloatChat Will Do

- Let users **ask questions in plain language** such as:
  - *"Show me salinity profiles near the equator in March 2023."*
  - *"Compare bio-geochemical parameters in the Arabian Sea for the last 6 months."*
  - *"Which floats are closest to this location?"*

- **Process Argo NetCDF data** into structured and queryable formats (SQL, Parquet).

- **Index metadata and summaries** in a vector store for context-aware retrieval.

- **Translate user intent into database queries** via LLM pipelines.

- **Display insights interactively**:
  - Geospatial float maps
  - Trajectory tracking
  - Profile comparisons
  - Timeâ€“depth heatmaps
  - Downloadable subsets (CSV, NetCDF, ASCII)

## Why It Matters

Argo floats form the backbone of global ocean observing, but the datasets are:
- Large (millions of profiles),
- Complex (NetCDF, QC flags, multiple variables),
- Technical (requiring domain expertise).

By building FloatChat, we make **ocean intelligence conversational**, helping:
- Scientists speed up exploratory analysis,
- Policymakers access relevant insights without technical barriers,
- Educators and students engage with ocean data interactively.

## Vision

FloatChat starts with **Indian Ocean Argo data** (via INCOIS/MoES) as a proof-of-concept, with the goal to expand towards:
- **Global Argo array**
- **BGC floats, gliders, moorings, and buoys**
- **Satellite datasets** for a truly integrated ocean information system.

Ultimately, the platform aims to be a **one-stop conversational gateway for ocean data discovery and decision-making**.
